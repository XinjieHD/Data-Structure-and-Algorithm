  This is the record of Data Structure and Algorithm that I learned

## List
  List is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
## Binary Search
  Tuple is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
## Binary Search
  Set is unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
## Binary Search
  Dictionary is ordered and changeable. No duplicate members.
## Binary Search
  
Binary search is a search algorithm that efficiently finds the position of a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search range in half. 
It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and narrows down the search space based on the comparison result.
